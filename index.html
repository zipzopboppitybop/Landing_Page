        "For all its enormous range of space, climate, and physical appearance,
        and for all the internal squabbles, contentions, and strivings, Texas
        has a tight cohesiveness perhaps stronger than any other section of
        America. Rich, poor, Panhandle, Gulf, city, country, Texas is the
        obsession, the proper study, and the passionate possession of all
        Texans.
